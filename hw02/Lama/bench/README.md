#### Benchmark suite for pretty printing

Files:

- `p.ml` -- an implementation of pretty-printer in meta-language
- `pp_default.m4` -- macro that converts `p.ml` into strightforward pretty printer
- `pp_gt.m4` -- a macro that converts `p.ml` into GT-based pretty printer
- `bench_main.ml` -- runner of benhcmark1
- `demo_infix.ml` -- demo about infix operator pretty printing

Compilation: hit `make`.

###### Benchmark `bench.exe`

Searches for input files in `../stdlib` or `./stdlib` and measures two pretty-printers:

- straightforward one from `Pprint_default.ml` (generated by `pp_default.m4` from `p.ml`)
- the one using our approach: `Pprint_gt.ml`  (generated by `pp_gt.m4` from `p.ml`)


###### demo `demo_infix.exe`

Pretty prints a small piece of code by two approaches:

- generated using our approach: `Pprint_gt.ml`
- modified `Pprint_gt.ml`: we are printing infix names in a prettier way. It is not possible to modify straightforward approach without pain
