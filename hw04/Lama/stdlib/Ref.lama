-- This unit provides an implementation for first-class references emulation.

-- Creates a new reference cell with contents x
public fun ref (x) {
  [x]
}

-- Returns the contents of the cell x
public fun deref (x) {
  x[0]
}

-- Assigns a new value y into the cell x
public infix ::= before := (x, y) {
  x[0] := y
}
