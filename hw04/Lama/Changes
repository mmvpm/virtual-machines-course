LaMa 1.10
---------

Version 1.10 clears some inconsistnces in 1.00. The language is *not* top-down compatible
with 1.00, but the conversion is simple.

# Language features:

- Removed keywords: local, repeat, until, boxed, unboxed, length, string;
- Added keywords: var, val, box;
- local variable declarations syntax changed: local x... -> var x...;
- repeat ... until syntax changed: now do .. while .. od. Note the inversion in
  the condition while converting from repeat... to do..while...;
- .length and .string are now regular functions; hence a conventional synax string (x) and
  length (x) is possible;
- pattern syntax changed: #boxed -> #box, #unboxed -> #val, #string -> #str;
- scope expressions are integrated with ( ... ) primaries; thus,
  nested scopes are introduced with *round* brackets;
- no more List.singleton is needed since there is no more conflict between one-element lists
  and scoped expressions.
