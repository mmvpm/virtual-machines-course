\chapter{Implementation-dependent Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The following limitations are in effect for \textsc{x86-32} platform implementation:

\begin{itemize}
\item the range of representable integers is [-1073741824..1073741823] (31-bit signed in two-complement representation);
\item the maximal length of array/string/number of S-expression parameters is 536870911 (29-bit unsigned integer);
\item the minimal address space size is 2GB (garbage collector requirement);
\item the maximal number of S-expression constructor name symbols taken into account is 5.
\end{itemize}
